## WRTDStidal

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fawda123/wtreg_for_estuaries.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fawda123/wtreg_for_estuaries)

This is the development repository for the WRTDStidal package.  Functions within this package can be used to model chlorophyll time series from tidal datasets.  The approach follows on previous methods described in the [EGRET](https://github.com/USGS-R/EGRET) package developed by USGS for non-tidal waters.

The development version of this package can be installed as follows:

```r
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('fawda123/WRTDStidal')
library(WRTDStidal)
```

See the documentation for available functions and examples.
